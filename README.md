# Web_Convener
This is my web_convener assignment

1) For the first question , index.html is the main file which you can use to access the itc website designed by me.
2) Here is a link to a video of how it looks: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Knozsfh69CWJ0bqCm8ydpf5EnrhSHAXm/view?usp=sharing

3) For the second question I have used react for the front end mainly and express for back end,I have used these to perform functions like creating data using frontend and publishing on back end which can later be accessed again by frontend in tabular format.

4) I have not included the node modules folder as Github doesn't allow that large files. You just need to clone the repo and install node.js react and express.js , then before running your backend using node app.js you must just run this command npm-i and your system will download the necessary files in node_modules by itself.

5) React framework for frontend and express.js for backend(only basic) : for second question. Simple html and css with media queries to make it responsive :for first question.
6) The same link provided earlier can be accessed to see this website also.
